## CSS Only Cubes Hover Effects

Check this another amazing CSS effect!  This time using hover pseudo-class, fake 3D transformation (using Skew property) and the nice, colorful and the almost always welcome filters: drop-shadow and hue-rotate!

I hope you enjoy interacting with it as I enjoyed coding from the Online Tutorials [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oc2S3Wo-I1A&t=10s) (I added a couple of little animations to make the breathing effect).

This is pure HTML and CSS ONLY!!

I hope you like it, code it and [watch it](https://gustavolando.github.io/otCSSOnlyCubesHoverEffects/) !
